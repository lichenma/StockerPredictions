# Stock Analysis in Python 

Exploring financial data with object-oriented programming and additive models. This project will follow a towardsdatascience article on `Stocker` - a Python class-based tool for stock analysis and prediction. 


## Getting started with Stocker 

After installing the required libraries, the first thing we need to do is import the Stocker class into our Python session. We can do this from an interactive Python session or a Jupyter Notebook started in the directory with the script.


```python
from stocker import Stocker
```
